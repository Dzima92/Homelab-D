Digital Manifesto: “In the Shadow of Neurons”
I don’t create to show.
I create so that one day the system I’m in won’t be able to break me.

I build a network — not for fame, not for likes.
But so that a lonely signal, breaking through filters, finds a way.

I don’t create a network, but a shelter.
I don’t look for noise — I listen to the silence between packets.

I am the one who is not afraid to go beyond the visible.
